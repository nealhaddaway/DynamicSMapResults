# The grey text between '```' signifies 'code chunks' that should be run when the file is 'knitted'. The code is run in the background and will not be shown in the output document, but only the figures and text values will. Code that is run 'in-line' in the main text is indicated by '`r [code]`'. Figures and tables are cross-referenced using the 'bookdown' package and are indicated in the text by '\@ref(fig:chunk_name)', where 'chunk_name' is the name of the code chunk that runs the particular fig (figure) or tab (table). The codechunk is named using a single string following the '``` {r ' code (e.g. this code chunk is called 'setup'). This setup chunk sets the general otpions for the whole document so that the code is not shown (echo=FALSE). The first two code chunks are run together but are distinct, operationally.

## The systematic mapping process {-}
Details of the number of records retained through each stage of the review process are provided in Figure \@ref(fig:flowchart). A total of 38,325 potentially relevant records were identified across all of the resources searched. A total of 25,683 unique records was screened for eligibility, with 347 eligible records following full text screening. The final systematic map database contains `r num_stud` studies from `r num_art` articles.

## The systematic map database and visualisations {-}
### Descriptive information {-}

**Publication year:** As expected, there has been a significant increase in the number of published articles on the topic over the last 20 years (Figure \@ref(fig:yearplot)). Interestingly, there may be evidence of a reduction in publication rate over the most recent 5 years from 2014 to 2018. The earliest record in our database is from 1981. Since searches were performed in 2019, representation from this year is incomplete.

```{r yearplot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Plot showing the final number of articles included in the systematic map by publication year.", results = "hide", fig.keep = 'all'} 
# The settings above ensure the code is not printed, warnings and messages are suppressed, a figure caption is included, and the R console output is hidden.
yearplot <- ggplot2::ggplot(data = articledat, 
                           ggplot2::aes(x = as.numeric(year))) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(stat = "bin", 
                    binwidth = 1, 
                    color = 'White', 
                    fill = '#8CB3B0') + 
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() + 
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Publication year", 
    y = "Number of studies")
pdf(file = 'figures/figure 2.pdf', width = (dev.size())[1], height = (dev.size())[2]) # This code and the following lines (to 'dev.off()') saves the figure as a PDF in the 'figures' folder.
  yearplot
dev.off()
yearplot
```


**Publication type:** Some `r round((type_art/num_art)*100, digits = 0)`% of articles in the map database are traditional research papers, with only `r type_thes` theses, `r type_conf` conference papers, and `r type_rep` report. This may in some degree reflect the ease with which traditional research articles can be discovered, but may also be the result of the complex and expensive GHG measurement equipment needed for this type of research: it may be unlikely that unpublished reports would be conducted on a local or organisation scale.
\newline 
\newline 
**Country:** The choropleth in Figure \@ref(fig:choroplot) displays the number of studies per country in the map. Some `r length(above10pccountries)` countries each represented more than 10% of the total studies in the evidence base: `r paste0(paste(above10pccountries[1:length(above10pccountries)-1], collapse = ', '), ', and ', above10pccountries[length(above10pccountries)])`. Much of the evidence came from Europe (a total of 227 studies).


```{r choroplot, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Choropleth showing the number of studies per country in the systematic map database."}
# This code chunk includes a pregenerated figure that is saved in the working directory along with a caption so taht it can be cross referenced in the text.
knitr::include_graphics('./choropleth.png')
```


**Soil texture:** The most frequently reported soil texture information was from the [USDA Natural resources conservation service soil texture classification system](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/soils/survey/class/). Figure \@ref(fig:soiltextplot) shows the distribution of soil texture classifications across the evidence base. A large number of studies (`r soilnr` of `r num_stud`) did not report the soil texture classification. 

``` {r soiltextplot, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Soil texture classifications of studies in the systematic map", results = "hide", fig.keep = 'all'}
soiltextplot <- ggplot2::ggplot(data = data, 
                           ggplot2::aes(x = soilorder)) +
