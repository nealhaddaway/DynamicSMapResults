# DynamicSMapResults

This R package is a template/demonstration of how to use R Markdown with a systematic map database (as a CSV file) to generate updatable results text, such that any modifications to the map database are reflected in the text automatically using R objects and data manipulations that occur inside the document (but this code is not shown). 

The code includes data wrangling (including the R equivalent of VLOOKUP in Excel), figure plotting, table generation, cross referencing of figures and tables, in-line referencing of objects created from the database (e.g. specific values or summary counts of a variable level).

The template includes full code annotation and examples from a real ongoing systematic map.
